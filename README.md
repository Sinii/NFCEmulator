### Emulating NFC Cards
1. **Select Card**: Choose a saved card from the list
2. **Start Emulation**: Tap "Start Emulation" to begin emulating the card
3. **Use Card**: The device will now respond as the emulated NFC card
4. **Stop Emulation**: Tap "Stop Emulation" to end the emulation

### Managing Cards
- **View Details**: Tap on any saved card to see detailed information
- **Delete Cards**: Use the delete button to remove unwanted cards
- **Refresh List**: Use the refresh button to update the card list

## Permissions

The app requires the following permissions:
- `android.permission.NFC` - Access to NFC functionality
- `android.permission.BIND_NFC_SERVICE` - Host Card Emulation service
- `android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE` - Run emulation service in foreground
- `android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` - Save logs and card data (Android 12 and below)
- `android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` - Read saved data (Android 12 and below)
